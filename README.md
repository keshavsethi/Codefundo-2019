This is Idea Submission for codefundo++ where we will give suggest on how block chain Could Secure Elections.

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
Elections, referenda, and polls are very important processes & tools for the smooth operation of a modern democracy. We are trying to build a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate how you can make these processes more secure, reliable, and transparent using Azure Blockchain.

<h4>Election security vulnerabilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fake news & information warfare</li>
<li>Hacked voter registration databases</li>
<li>Hacked voting hardware</li>
<li>Compromised election reporting systems</li>
 <li>Post-election audit</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>How blockchain can be a solution </h4>
 <ul>
<li>Fake news & information warfare</li>
<li>Cryptographic media verification</li>
<li>Mobile apps for blockchain voting</li>
<li>Digital identity and blockchain voting</li>
 <li>Post-election audits on the blockchain</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Securing elections requires securing the entire process.</h3>
  <ul>
<li><h5>Information warfare</h5>Due to targeted disinformation campaigns, voters can have trouble determining fact-based sources to accurately inform their vote.Foreign influence operations are not less  like in August, Facebook announced it had identified and eliminated a new Russian network aimed at influencing Americans before the midterms thus information welfare is important concern.</li>
<li><h5>Electronic voter registration databases</h5>Tampering database can also be an important issue in election process. Removing sections of voters likely to support one candidate could effectively swing a close election. This also tempers personal information.</li>
<li><h5>Voting machinery and tabulation systems</h5>Hardware is most vulnerable part of process.Security experts agree that internet-connected voting machines, tabulation systems, and their networks are particularly vulnerable to election threats.</li>
<li><h5>Election reporting systems</h5>Manipulated reporting systems could announce inaccurate voting results. Hackers could also take over an official social media account and disseminate false results directly.

</li>
 <li><h5>Post-election audits</h5>Dismay over an election can prompt calls for a post-election audit comparing digital results to paper ballots. However, post-election audits are vulnerable to inaccuracy without proper voting machinery in place.

</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Technology to be used</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Azure block chain</li>
 <li>PYTHON-DJANGO</li>
 <li>ANGULAR</li>
 <li>Reactjs</li>
 <li>web3js</li>
 </ul>
 
 
 <h3>Now how blockchain can solve this</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><h5>Cryptographic media verification</h5>Essentially, voters would only consume media that is stamped with a unique cryptographic identifier, which — when cross-referenced with immutable records on a blockchain — can prove beyond a doubt where the media originated. Media without an identifier would be considered less trustworthy.
</li>
 <li><h5>Mobile apps for blockchain voting</h5>This part is bit tricky as momble phone is connected with internet and it can tamper elections. Votes are stored on the blockchain, inside what app calls a “digital lockbox” in the cloud. The digital lockbox is essentially a secure cloud database that is made extra-tamper-proof via blockchain’s immutable ledger technology. On primary day, county clerks unlock and collect the votes for tabulation.
 </li>
 
 <li><h5>Digital identity and blockchain voting </h5>Blockchain could help centralize the management of voter identities.
Blockchain elections require an assortment of identity data such as Aadhar card  and biometric data collected during online registration to match a voter with his or her digital identity in a government voter registration database. Increasingly, biometrics like iris and face data are being used to prove identity in conjunction with voting on blockchain.

<h5>now we plan to built election is one that is end-to-end verifiable. </h1>
